What is an abstract class in C++?
          -----------------
An abstract class is a class that is 
designed to be specifically used as a 
base class. An abstract class contains at
least one pure virtual function. You 
declare a pure virtual function by using
a pure specifier ( = 0 ) in the declaration
of a virtual member function in the class declaration.

Pure virtual function-> do nothing func
-------------------
It is use to create an abstract class.

What is a virtual function in C++?
          -----------------
A virtual function is a base class memberfunction
that you can redefine in a derived 
class to achieve polymorphism. You can declare
the function in the base class using the virtual keyword

What is virtual keyword?
       ---------
The virtual keyword is used to modify a method, 
allow it to be overridden in a derived class.

vTable:
-------
It is a table that contains the memory addresses
of all virtual functions of a class in the order
in which they are declared in a class. This table
is used to resolve function calls in dynamic/late
binding manner.

vPTR:
-----
When you create an object of a class which contains
virtual function then a hidden pointer gets created
automatically in that object by the compiler.

What is static keyword in C++?
        --------------
        
The static keyword belongs to the class. for calling the
static DM or DF we don't need to create the object.
Static function can access static DM only.


What is inline function?
       --------
An inline function is the compiler copies
the code from the function definition directly
into the code of the calling function rather
than creating a separate set of instructions
in memory.
