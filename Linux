Basic Questions
------------
1)What is Linux? Explain its architecture.

Linux is an open-source operating system 
based on Unix. Its architecture includes 
the kernel, system libraries, system utilities,
and user applications. The kernel handles 
core system tasks like memory management,
process management, and hardware communication.

2) How do you list files in a directory?

You can list files using the ls command.

3)Explain the difference between ls and ls -l.

ls lists files and directories in the current
directory. ls -l provides a detailed listing,
including file permissions, number of links,
owner, group, file size, and modification time.

4)What are inodes in Linux?

Inodes are data structures that
store information about files and 
directories, such as their size, 
owner, permissions, and disk location.

5) How do you check disk usage in Linux?

You can use the du command to check 
disk usage of files and directories, 
and df to check available and used disk 
space on mounted filesystems.

6) Explain the purpose of grep command. Provide an example.

grep searches for patterns in files.
Example: grep "pattern" filename searches for
"pattern" in filename.

7) How do you find a process ID (PID) in Linux?

Use the ps command, for example, ps aux | grep process_name.

8) What is the difference between ps and top?

ps provides a snapshot of current processes. 
top provides a dynamic, real-time view of 
running processes and their resource usage.

9) How do you set file permissions in Linux?

Use the chmod command. Example: chmod 755 
filename sets read, write, and execute permissions
for the owner, and read and execute permissions 
for group and others.

10) What is a symbolic link in Linux? How do
you create one?

A symbolic link is a file that points to another file or 
directory. Create one using ln -s target link_name.

11) What are the different types of file permissions in Linux?

The three types of permissions are read (r), write (w),
and execute (x). These can be set for the file owner,
group, and others.

12) Explain the process of handling signals in Linux.

Signals are used to communicate with processes. 
They can be handled by defining signal handlers 
in the program using the signal() system call.

13)How do you schedule a job in Linux using cron?

Edit the crontab file using crontab -e and add
a line with the schedule and command.
Example: 0 5 * * * /path/to/script runs a script daily at 5 AM.

14) What is the difference between hard link and soft link?

A hard link is an additional name for an existing file, 
sharing the same inode. A soft (symbolic) link is
a pointer to another file or directory.

15) Explain the concept of environment variables in Linux.

Environment variables are dynamic values that affect
the processes running on a system. 
Examples include PATH, HOME, and USER.

16) How do you use awk in Linux? Provide an example.

awk is a programming language for pattern scanning
and processing. Example: awk '{print $1}' 
file prints the first column of each line in file.

17) Explain how to use sed for text manipulation.

sed is a stream editor for filtering and transforming 
text. Example: sed 's/old/new/g' file replaces all
occurrences of "old" with "new" in file.

18) How do you check open ports in Linux?

Use the netstat -tuln, ss -tuln, or lsof -i commands.

19) Explain the difference between TCP and UDP.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is connection-oriented 
and ensures reliable data transfer. 

UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is connectionless and
does not guarantee delivery.

20)How do you check memory usage in Linux?

Use the free command or top/htop for a real-time view.

21) What are iptables? How do you configure them?

iptables is a firewall tool for packet filtering and NAT. 
Configure it using commands like iptables -A, iptables -D, 
and saving rules with iptables-save.

21) Describe the process of mounting a filesystem in Linux.

Use the mount command. Example: mount /dev/sda1 /mnt mounts the filesystem on /dev/sda1 to /mnt.

Performance and Optimization

22) How do you monitor system performance in Linux?

Use tools like top, htop, vmstat, iostat, and sar.

23) Explain the purpose of nice and renice.

nice sets the priority of a process when 
it is started.

renice changes the priority of an already running process.

24) What are cgroups and how are they used in Linux?

cgroups (control groups) limit, account, and isolate 
resource usage of processes. They are configured through
the /sys/fs/cgroup filesystem or tools like cgcreate and cgexec.

25) How do you optimize a Linux system for performance?

Methods include tuning kernel parameters, optimizing 
startup services, using performance monitoring tools,
and configuring disk I/O and network settings.

26) Explain the use of vmstat and iostat.

vmstat reports virtual memory statistics. 
iostat reports CPU and I/O statistics, useful 
for diagnosing performance issues related to disk I/O.

27) touch Command is use to create,change or modify timestamp of file.
